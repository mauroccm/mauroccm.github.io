## 🧩 Puzzle

- The 2016-2022 Yellow Fever (YF) wave was **unprecedented**. It breached historical barriers, spreading from the Amazon through the Cerrado and into the densely populated **Atlantic Forest**.

- [Critical questions:]{.my-red}
  - _How did the virus persist through temperate winters and high-altitude regions (< 16°C) that should have stopped transmission?_

## 🌡️ Hypothesis

- We propose that **anomalous weather conditions** (climate change & variability) created temporary bridges for viral survival.
  - Warmer Winters: Prevented viral die-off in historically cold zones.
  - Altered Rainfall: Sustained vector populations during dry seasons.

## Background {.scrollable .smaller}

Temperature anomalies are the biological constraints of the virus. The viral incubation speed depends on temperature conditions ([Bellone and Failoux, 2025](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.584846/full); [Johanssen et al, 2010](https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/83/1/article-p183.xml)).

Expected minimum temperature for Brazil (left), with emphasis on the Southeast region (right). The reference temperature was obtained by averaging the weekly minimal temperature between 1986 and 2015.

Climate anomalies during the YF outbreak

![Municipalities affected by yellow fever in the Southeast region of Brazil between January 2016 and June 2025 (red line). Municipalities affected by minimum temperature anomalies in the Southeast region of Brazil between January 2016 and June 2025 (dashed blue line). Data were aggregated by epidemiological week. We considered a climatic anomaly as a minimum temperature above 5 standard deviations from the expected average for the 30-year period (1986–2015).](figures/time_nCases_nAnomalies.png){width="100%"}

## Objectives {.smaller}

1. **Data Integration**
  - Building a comprehensive database linking NHP epizootics with fine-scale climate data (Temp, Rain, Wind, Vegetation).
2. **Spatio-Temporal Model**
  - Identifying "Thermal Corridors" and analyzing how microclimates allowed viral persistence during winter.
3. **Predictive Forecasting**
  - Developing a risk model using climate indicators as "early warning" signals for future outbreaks.

## Scientific Challenges

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- ⚠️ **Sampling Bias**
  - Dead monkeys are only found where people look.  
  - [**Solution:** Occupancy Modeling & "Observer Bias" Covariates.]{.my-red}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- ⚠️ **Microclimate vs. Macroclimate**
  - Satellites miss the warm tree hollows where mosquitoes hide.
  - [**Solution:** Topographic Downscaling & Canopy Adjustment.]{.my-red}

## Relevance and Impact {.smaller}

- 🚀 **Proactive Surveillance:** Moving from reactive monitoring to early warning.
- 🛡️ **Public Health:** Enabling vaccination campaigns months in advance.
- 🌍 **Scalability:** A framework replicable for WNV and Leishmaniasis.
