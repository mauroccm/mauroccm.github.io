## 🧩 Puzzle

- The 2016-2022 Yellow Fever (YF) wave was **unprecedented**. It breached historical barriers, spreading from the Amazon through the Cerrado and into the densely populated **Atlantic Forest**.

- [Critical questions:]{.my-red}
  - _How did the virus persist through temperate winters and high-altitude regions (< 16°C) that should have stopped transmission?_

## 🌡️ Hypothesis

- We propose that **anomalous weather conditions** (climate change & variability) created temporary bridges for viral survival.
  - Warmer Winters: Prevented viral die-off in historically cold zones.
  - Altered Rainfall: Sustained vector populations during dry seasons.

## Background {.scrollable .smaller}

Temperature anomalies are the biological constraints of the virus. The viral incubation speed depends on temperature conditions ([Bellone and Failoux, 2025](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.584846/full); [Johanssen et al, 2010](https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/83/1/article-p183.xml)).

## 🎯 Objectives {.smaller}

1. **Data Integration**
  - Building a comprehensive database linking NHP epizootics with fine-scale climate data (Temp, Rain, Wind, Vegetation).
2. **Spatio-Temporal Model**
  - Identifying "Thermal Corridors" and analyzing how microclimates allowed viral persistence during winter.
3. **Predictive Forecasting**
  - Developing a risk model using climate indicators as "early warning" signals for future outbreaks.

## Relevance and Impact {.smaller}

- 🚀 **Proactive Surveillance:** Moving from reactive monitoring to early warning.
- 🛡️ **Public Health:** Enabling vaccination campaigns months in advance.
- 🌍 **Scalability:** A framework replicable for WNV and Leishmaniasis.
