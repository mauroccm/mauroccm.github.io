- 🔭 I’m currently working on climate and health at [Institut Pasteur de São Paulo](https://pasteur-network.org/what-we-do/projects/climate-and-health-observatory-accelerator-project/); and image-based spatial transcriptomics data analysis in the [Computational Systems Biology Laboratory](https://www.csbiology.org/) at University of Sao Paulo ([USP](usp.br)).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning One Health approach to model climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases.
- 🤝🏻 I’m looking for collaboration on climate and health data integration analysis.
- 🤔 I seek help in quantifying vaccine hesitancy.
- 💬 Ask me about Machine Learning and (Bio)image analysis ideas.
